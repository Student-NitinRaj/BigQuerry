## 🔍 SQL Operations Performed

### 1️⃣ Data Exploration

* `SELECT` and `LIMIT` queries to explore raw data
* Schema inspection and column validation

### 2️⃣ Filtering & Aggregation

* `WHERE` clauses for year-wise and region-wise filtering
* `GROUP BY` with `SUM()` and `AVG()` for sales analysis
* `ORDER BY` for sorting and ranking

### 3️⃣ Window Functions

* `ROW_NUMBER()` to rank models by yearly sales
* `RANK()` to handle ties in sales volume

### 4️⃣ Conditional Logic

* `CASE WHEN` statements to:

  * Categorize sales into High / Medium / Low
  * Create binary flags for analytics and ML readiness

### 5️⃣ Performance Analysis

* Year-wise total sales trend
* Color-wise sales comparison
* Model-wise and region-wise performance analysis

---

## 📈 Visualization

BigQuery’s built-in visualization tools were used to:

* Create bar charts for yearly sales trends
* Compare sales volumes across different years
* Validate analytical insights visually

---

## 🤖 BigQuery ML (Extension)
